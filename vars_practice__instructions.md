## Startup
1. Open VS Code.
2. Under 3_Practice Folder, Create a new file called vars_practice.py
3. Copy Paste the code below into that file 

## Instructions

I want you all to create a mad-libs game in python.

To do so, you will need to create at exactly 7 variables, each with an `input()` function [using an appropriate prompt]

Your program will then output a story (Much like the investigate)!

Have fun with this assignment, you story can be as silly as you want, just make sure it's school appropriate.

## Starter Code
```python
"""
HEADER COMMENTS
"""

# Input
noun_1 = input("Please enter a noun: ")

# Processing
# Output
print(f"It was a rainy Tuesday and the {noun_1} was giving me some trouble.")
print(f"It has been the most annoying part of my week.")
```
